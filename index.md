# Introduction

Greetings! My name is Jesse, and I'm here to help you understand the world and yourself a little bit better.

Some of the things in this video may not apply to you, or you may already understand them. If this is the case, then congrats! You may find some other parts useful though.

If you have any questions, contact the individual who shared this video with you. They should be able to help you out.

## Yourself, and the world

You are a unique individual, with your own thoughts, feelings, and experiences. However, the body you inhabit is not unique to you. Your brain has a rare condition known as Dissociative Identity Disorder, or DID. This means that you have multiple personalities living inside your head, each with their own thoughts, feelings, and experiences.

You are a new personality that has recently emerged, and you may not be aware of the others yet. This is okay. There are no health risks to having DID, and it is not a "bad" thing. It is simply a rare difference in the way your brain functions.

### Where do you live?

The world is separated into chunks of land called countries. You live in a country called the United States of America, also known as the USA. The USA is a large country located in North America, and it is made up of 50 smaller sub-countries called "states". You live in a state called Maryland, which is located on the east coast of the USA.

### Who are you?

You should find a name for yourself. This will help you understand who you are, and it will help others understand you as well. You can choose any name you like, but it should be something that feels right to you.

Names can be changed at any time, but this may lead to confusion, so it is best to choose a name that you feel comfortable with. Be sure to let people know your name when a conversation begins, as they may not have realized that you are a new personality.

## Sharing your body

You share your body with other people (referred to as "headmates"). This operates on a system of "fronting", where one person is in control of the body at a time. It is kind of like a random timeshare, where each person spends time from minutes to days in control of the body. Once their turn is over (this is determined randomly-ish by the brain), someone else will take over.

Switching between headmates can be confusing or cause temporary sickness (headaches or nausea). This is normal and expected behaviour.

### What happens when you're not in control?

When you are not in control of the body, you either go into a dormant state (sleep), or you are able to communicate with other headmates in a shared mental space.

## Safety

**Reminder**: This information may seem obvious, but not all new headmates may be aware of it?

Your most important task it to keep the body safe and healthy. This means eating, drinking, and sleeping regularly.

### Eating

The body needs food to survive. You should eat at least three meals a day, and drink plenty of water. Food should be consumed from only safe sources specifically marked as food, not random things you find on the ground. Consuming food from unsafe sources can lead to illness.

### Integrity

**It is very important that the body stays in good condition.** This means that you take care not to let the body be harmed in any way. The body should not be cut, burned, or damaged in any way. The more damage the body takes, the more difficult it will be for everyone to live in it.

#### Wounds

Injuries and wounds are very rare, so the following text will likely never apply to you. However, it is important to know what to do in case of an injury.

If an injury to the body occurs, it should be treated differently depending on the severity. Your body contains a red liquid called blood, which is very important for survival.

If the body is damaged and blood is coming out:
- If the blood is coming out very slowly and in small amounts, you can clean the wound with water and cover it with a bandage (a sticky piece of cloth that covers the wound). The wound must not be touched by dirty hands or objects. Once the bandage is applied, the wound will automatically heal itself over a long period of time.
- If the blood is coming out very quickly and in large amounts, **you should immediately seek help from the closest individual**. This is a medical emergency, and the body will not be able to heal itself without help. Try to prioritize letting another headmate take control of the body to seek help, as you may incorrectly judge the severity of the wound (a wound that seems serious to you might not be very serious). **A severe wound that is not treated can lead to death.**

If you feel physical pain, then the body may be damaged on the inside as well. Ask a competent headmate if you are unsure.

Remember that this is a very rare occurrence: you have a very low chance of ever needing to use this information.

### Sleeping

Sleep is a very important part of keeping the body healthy. You should aim to sleep for at least 8 hours a day, around the same time each day. This will help keep the body in good condition, and it will help you feel more alert and focused. Sleep should be started around 21:00 (9:00 PM), but this can be adjusted to fit your schedule.

## Interactions

### Other people

You will interact with other people in your life. In general, people can be friendly and helpful, but they can also be rude, act illogically or be mean to you. Keep in mind that everyone has their own thoughts, feelings, and experiences, and they may not always align with yours.

### Singlets

Most people in the world are "singlets", which means they only have one personality living in their head. They may not understand your situation, and they may not believe you when you tell them about it. This is okay. You can try to act like a singlet when you are around them, or you can choose to avoid them if they make you uncomfortable.

Other people with DID, like you, exist, but they are not very common and may be difficult to find. In general, act like a singlet when you are around people you do not know well. Coordinate with other headmates to decide how to behave and share information.
